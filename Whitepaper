# 🌱 Creeping Vine ($CREEP) Whitepaper

---

## 1. Introduction
Creeping Vine ($CREEP) is a **fair-launch meme token** inspired by artist **Matt Furie’s** surreal world — specifically the *“Creeping Vine”* skeleton-and-flower motif, first named in his recent solo show at Left Field Gallery.  
The image of vines sprouting from bones mirrors crypto’s own cycle of chaos and renewal.  

- No Presale  
- No VC  
- No Team Wallets  
- Liquidity Burnt 🔥

## 2. Vision & Philosophy
$CREEP merges:
- **Underground art culture** → psychedelic symbolism of renewal in Furie’s work  
- **Crypto meme culture** → humor, chaos, and degen community spirit  

Our mission is to grow like a vine: quietly at first, then everywhere.
